## üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:
### Password Manager

This is my most ambitious and potentially most useful project yet: a Python-based, local, and offline password manager. It's designed as a secure alternative to cloud-based services like Dashlane or LastPass. While those are proven to be secure, an offline manager provides the extra peace of mind that comes from knowing your data is never in the cloud. For maximum security, it features encryption and two-factor authentication, and I'll be building on my previous password generator project to include a more advanced version directly within the manager.

### YouTube-to-MP3

Developed a **Python** script that lets you donwnload one video or even a whole YouTube playlist as MP3 files.

### Bulk File Renamer

A **Bash** script that can bulk rename files in a Linux directory based on a few simple parameters.

### Website Uptime Monitor
[Source Code & Files](https://github.com/AyaanJK/website-uptime-monitor)

Created a **Lua** script that reads a list of websites from a .txt file that can be edited and returns the network status in the form of 'UP' or 'DOWN'.

### Password Generator
[Source Code & Files](https://github.com/AyaanJK/password-generator)

Developed a simple password generator using **Python**. The script lets the user input paramters such as password length and the inclusion of numbers and special characters. It then generates a random combination of characters based on the inputted parameters.

### File Organiser
[Source Code & Files](https://github.com/AyaanJK/file-organiser)

Used **Python** to create a simple script that allows the user to edit the code with the desired directory they want to sort files within. Depending on the extension types, files are sorted in folders with the name of the file type. As it was a beginner project I hadn't yet experimented with libraries such as Tkinter to let the user choose a directory from a GUI.

### Snake Game

To further help solidify my **Python** basics I created a simple Snake game. Nothing too special here, a very simple and basic game.

### Pong Game
[Source Code & Files](https://github.com/AyaanJK/pong-game)

As a first **Python** project I created a Pong game reminiscent of the original Atari game. In hindsight, this may have been too advanced for me at that stage, however I learnt a lot from the experience.
