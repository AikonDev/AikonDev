Created a **Lua** script that reads a list of websites from a .txt file that can be edited and returns the network status in the form of 'UP' or 'DOWN'.

### Password Generator
[Source Code & Files](https://github.com/AyaanJK/password-generator)

Developed a simple password generator using **Python**. The script lets the user input paramters such as password length and the inclusion of numbers and special characters. It then generates a random combination of characters based on the inputted parameters.

### File Organiser
[Source Code & Files](https://github.com/AyaanJK/file-organiser)

Used **Python** to create a simple script that allows the user to edit the code with the desired directory they want to sort files within. Depending on the extension types, files are sorted in folders with the name of the file type. As it was a beginner project I hadn't yet experimented with libraries such as Tkinter to let the user choose a directory from a GUI.

### Snake Game
[Source Code & Files](https://github.com/AyaanJK/snake-game)

To further help solidify my **Python** basics I created a simple Snake game. Nothing too special here, a very simple and basic game.

### Pong Game
[Source Code & Files](https://github.com/AyaanJK/pong-game)

As a first **Python** project I created a Pong game reminiscent of the original Atari game. In hindsight, this may have been too advanced for me at that stage, however I learnt a lot from the experience.
